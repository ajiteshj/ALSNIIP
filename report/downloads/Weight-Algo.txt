Weight Assignment

Problem statement
Assign weights to an unweighted network dataset to obtain a clear and complete view of the network.

DataSet
1. Co-authorship data: This dataset contains Authors where the they are represented by the unique author's ID's. A relation exist between two author ID's only if both have coauthored a book. Each author can be involved in writing more than one book. In the graph format authors are represented by nodes or vertices and the relations between them are represented by the presence of edge between them. This is an undirected graph having 757 vertices and 1000 edges. 
2. Email Communication Data: This dataset contains the IDs of individuals who are actively involved in a communication network via email. A relation between two IDs exist if any one of the two individuals communicate through email. In the graph format, individuals are represented by nodes or vertices and the relations between them are represented by the presence of edge between them. This is a directed graph having 1133 vertices and 10903 edges.

Pseudocode/Algorithm
Data : Unweighted RawDataFrame
Result : Weighted data

Step 1 : Convert the data frame into graphs . Directed or undirected based on the data.
Step 2 : Remove all self loops and repeated edges.
Step 3 : Compute the similarity score using the intrinsic graph attributes.
Step 4 : Determine the weights from the similarity score.
Step 5 : Assign weights to each edge of the graph.
Step 6 : Generate weighted data file.

Procedure
Given an unweighted social network dataset, It is possible to convert it into a weighted datagraph by considering the features which are intrinsic to the graph.  This process is performed using R software which is a data mining tool for Big data. R packages such as igraph, sna, linkcomm and network are used. Initially, a feature-rich social network data is collected. It is converted into graphs. Outliers like self loops and repeated edges are removed. A similarity score is calculated from a formula devised by taking into account the network attributes and their definitions depending upon the data. Weights are computed from the score and are assigned to each edge of the graph. Finally, these weights are appended to the input data and a new weighted dataset file is created.
