We wish to express our sincere appreciation and gratitude to the Department of Information Science and Engineering for their extended long-term support and giving us the opportunity to analyse the interactions and structure within a social network. We would like to extend our hearty gratitude to our Principal, Dr.~N V R Naidu, our HOD Dr.~Vijay Kumar B P and especially to our guide, Krishnaraj P M for his vast reserve of patience, knowledge, constant feedback and guidance. This project would never have been completed without the unending encouragement and devotion of our family and friends.
