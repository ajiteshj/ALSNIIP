This is to certify that Ajitesh Jayanth (USN- 1MS12IS011) , Akshay Rao A K (USN- 1MS12IS013), Ankith Mohan(USN- 1MS12IS014) and G Akash Rohit (USN- 1MS12IS037) who were working for their \textbf{IS811 SENIOR PROJECT} under my guidance, have completed the work as per my satisfaction with the topic \textbf{Analysis Of Large Social Networks To Investigate Intriguing Patterns}. To the best of my understanding the work to be submitted in dissertation does not contain any work, which has been previously carried out by others and submitted by the candidates for themselves for the award of any degree anywhere.
